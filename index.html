        <p><em>Student at <strong><a href="https://www.pes.edu/">PES University</a></strong>.</em></p>
        <p>The headlines of newspaper articles read -"INDIA IS ON GUARD", "WHO declares EBOLA a Public Health Emergency of International Concern". I was highly intrigued by these headlines and I took this topic as my research project at the regional
          science fair and developed a mathematical model to foresee the statistical spread of an infectious disease and won various awards at national and international science fairs. Moreover, I also designed an android app that can help monitor
          the
          number of people affected near a person using GPS tracking, treatments, precautions and updates during any health emergency. And during this process, I fell in love with computing and the technology linked with it. That's when I decided to
          pursue
          my under graduate studies in Computer Science. </p>
